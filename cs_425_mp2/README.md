# CS425_MP2

## Instructions
First clone the GitHub repository.

To start the code for each machine, start the script as follows:

    python3 node.py

For this MP, we use machine #1 as the introducer node. So, make sure you run the above command on machine #1 first. Then type "join" once prompted.
For successive machine joins, start the Python script and then just use the commands linked in this Piazza post (https://piazza.com/class/ll3vjcrbvnt28a/post/361) to display the relevant information.
For example, to list the ID of a machine, type 
    list_self

To show the current membership list, type
    list_mem

etc.
